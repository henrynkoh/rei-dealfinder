Sound familiar?

## 🎯 **Campaign 4: Educational Series**

### **Email 1: Voice Note Mastery**
**Subject:** The voice note technique that's changing everything 🎤

**Body:**
```
[FIRST_NAME],

Most people use voice notes wrong.

They record random thoughts, never review them, and wonder why they're not more productive.

Today I'll show you the "Voice Note Mastery" technique that separates pros from amateurs:

🎯 THE 3-PART VOICE NOTE STRUCTURE:

**Part 1: Context (10 seconds)**
"This is about [project/topic], recorded on [situation]"

**Part 2: Content (1-3 minutes)**  
Your actual thoughts, ideas, or information

**Part 3: Next Action (10 seconds)**
"Next step is to [specific action]"

🔥 WHY THIS WORKS:

1. **Context** helps the AI categorize correctly
2. **Structured content** improves transcription accuracy  
3. **Next actions** turn ideas into progress

🎯 EXAMPLE:

"This is about the Johnson project, recorded during my commute. 

[2 minutes of brilliant ideas]

Next step is to email the team this transcript and schedule a brainstorming session."

TRY IT TODAY:
Record one voice note using this structure. Watch how much more actionable your ideas become.
