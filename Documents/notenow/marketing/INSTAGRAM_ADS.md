NoteFlow combines everything I was using:
• My study notes (better than Notion for mobile)
• Voice recordings (transcribes INSTANTLY)
• Project databases (custom fields for everything)

The voice feature is incredible - I record while walking to class and have perfect transcripts by the time I arrive.
